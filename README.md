# rsd-sensor-prediction
A machine learning project focused on predicting the (x, y) coordinates of particle positions using data from an RSD (Resistive Silicon Detector) sensor. The solution involves feature selection, noise reduction, and ensemble models, including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Trees.
